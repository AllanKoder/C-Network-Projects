# Simple C Web Server Network Project

This is a relatively simple web server that serves files. 

The project idea was inspired by [Beej's guide to Networking Concepts](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet0/), and with help from [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)

The simple web server is for HTML, text documents, PNGS, and downloading every other type of file
